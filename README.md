# MyPyPSA-Ger
MyPyPSA-Ger

MyPyPSA-Ger, a myopic optimization model developed to represent the German energy system with a detailed mapping of the electricity sector, on a highly disaggregated level, spatially and temporally, with regional differences and investment limitations.

MyPyPSA-Ger was built using the Modeling Framework [PyPSA](https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa), and upon [PyPSA-Eur](https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur).

The model is described in the paper [MyPyPSA-Ger: Introducing CO2 taxes on a multi-regional myopic roadmap of the German electricity system towards achieving the 1.5 Â°C target by 2050](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261922000587)
